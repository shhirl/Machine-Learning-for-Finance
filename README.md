1. Introduction
The typical method for variable selection when implementing Gaussian process models is automatic relevance determination (ARD). In this project I follow the paper by Paananen et al, to implement two variable selection methods that are proposed for Gaussian process models via sensitivity analysis of the posterior predictive distribution. I implement and reproduce their empirical results on synthetic data to show an improvement in variable selection compared to automatic relevant determination. I also explore other alternatives for ARD in the literature.
